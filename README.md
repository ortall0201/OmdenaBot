📌 Challenge Title: [Building Agentic-based Mental Health Chatbot using Langchain Workflows](https://www.omdena.com/chapter-challenges/building-agentic-based-mental-health-chatbot-using-langchain-workflows)

🎯 **Objectives**
- Provide personalized feedback and mental health tips.

- Use LLM agents for emotionally adaptive responses with grounded knowledge folder containing necessery docs from data collection.

- Build RAG-based retrieval, multi-agent flow, and real-time insights.

- Enable dashboard tracking - **under construction**
  
- Enable crisis alerts, and integration with third-party (authorized by user) support, for the benefite of both user and his therapist, via Meta's MCP connection to Whatsup API. - **under construction**
  
- Enable profile feedback scoring (GAD) - **under construction**
  
- Enable excercises by extracting bot's response into an interactive activity. - For example: If it's a kid, then it might be a link to a game or meditation excercise according to bot's response (trigger words) - **under construction**
  
- Enable dashboard monthly report download or sent via whatsup for user/therapist, maybe even for research (The user cosents his details and conversations are being recorded) - **under construction**
  
- Further implementations can be : User feedback (like/didn't like the bot's response) , logs folder saves csv's for later analysis and predictions on users profiles according to their inputs. Also making the app a multi user app for all family or for a therapist list of patients. **under construction**
